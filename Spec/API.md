## User Management
Account creation and maintenance.

### User Creation
User creation requires that the client has obtained an access token and user ID from Facebook's
JavaScript SDK (or equivalent).

Request:
```
POST /api/v1/auth
{
    "user_id": "<user-id>",
    "access_token": "<access-token>"
}
```

A response with a status of 200 indicates that the request was successful. Note that this route
can be used to update users' access tokens as well (e.g. if they sign in on a new device).

### User Authentication
After registering an access token with the `/api/v1/auth` route, the client can make authenticated
requests using two headers:
```
X-CUE-USER-ID: <user-id>
X-CUE-ACCESS-TOKEN: <access-token>
```

Any unauthorized requests will receive a 401 response. All routes require authentication (with a
couple of exceptions like the user creation route above).

### User Information
Use this route to change/set a user's name:
```
PUT /api/v1/user
{
    "name": "<name>"
}
```

Use this route to retrieve a user's name:
```
GET /api/v1/user
```

Response:
```
{
    "name": "<name>"
}
```

## Deck Manipulation
Create and edit decks.

### Deck Creation
Request:
```
POST /api/v1/deck/add
{
    "name": "<deckname>",
    "tags": ["<tag1>", "<tag2>", ...],
    "device": "<devicename>",
    "cards": [
        { "front": "<Q>", "back": "<A>" },
        ...
    ]
}
```
Where `<deckname>` is the name of the deck to be created, "tags" specifies a list of tags that can be searched on, and "cards" contains an array of cards. In this case, cards are just dictionaries with two keys: "front" and "back" which contain the front and back text for the card. Cards are put in the deck in the same order that they appear in the list. Decks created with this route are automatically added to the user's library.

Response: [Standard Full Deck Response](#full-response)

### Deck Edits
Request:
```
PUT /api/v1/deck/<uuid>
{
    "device": "<device_name>",
    "parent_deck_version": "<parent-deck-version>",
    "parent_user_data_version" "<parent-user-data-version>",
    "name": "<name>",
    "public": true | false,
    "unshare": true,
    "tags": ["<tag1>", "<tag2>", ...],
    "actions": [
        {
            "action": "add" | "edit" | "delete",
            ...
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
Request description:
- `uuid` (required): the unique identifier for the deck being edited
- `device`: the name of the device
- `parent_deck_version` (required): the current version of the deck
- `parent_user_data_version` (required): the current version of the user data for the deck
- `name`: the name that the deck will be changed to
- `public`: determines whether or not the deck should be discoverable by other users
- `unshare`: nullifies the deck's share code if it exists
- `tags`: the new list of strings that describe the deck
- `actions`: a list of actions (add, edit, delete) as described below

Add action:
```
{
    "action": "add",
    "front": "<Q>",
    "back": "<A>",
    "position", <pos>,
    "needs_review": true | false
}
```

Edit action:
```
{
    "action": "edit",
    "card_id": "<card-id>"[,
    "front": "<Q>",
    "back": "<A>",
    "position": <pos>,
    "needs_review": true | false]
}
```

Delete action:
```
{
    "action": "delete",
    "card_id": "<card-id>"
}
```

Response: [Standard Full Deck Response](#full-response)

### Deck Overwrites
This route will allow a deck to be overwritten. This can be handy when there is a version conflict and the client opts to keep the version that was not synchronized with the server. This route is almost identical to the route for deck creation (with some minor differences).

When this route is used, all existing ratings for the deck will be maintained. It should be noted that this operation can only be done by the owner of the deck.

Request:
```
POST /api/v1/deck/<uuid>
{
    "name": "<deckname>",
    "tags": ["<tag1>", "<tag2>", ...],
    "public": true | false,
    "device": "<devicename>",
    "cards": [
        {
            "uuid": "<uuid>" | null,
            "front": "<Q>",
            "back": "<A>",
            "position": "<P>",
            "needs_review": true | false
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
Request description:
- `name`: the name of the deck
- `tags`: a list of strings that can be searched on
- `public`: describes whether the deck should be publicly discoverable or not
- `device`: name of the device
- `cards`: a list of objects representing cards. The order of the cards in the array will reflect their position in the deck.
    - `uuid`: the UUID for an existing card, if the card is new then `null`
    - `front`: the text on the front of the card
    - `back`: the text on the back of the card
    - `position`: position of the card in the deck
    - `needs_review` (optional): indicates if the user wants to mark the card as needs review

Response: [Standard Full Deck Response](#full-response)

### Flagging Cards For Review
This route allows cards to be marked with a flag for further review.

Request:
```
PUT /api/v1/deck/<uuid>/flag
{
    "device": "<device_name>",
    "parent_deck_version": "<parent-deck-version>",
    "parent_user_data_version": "<parent-user-data-version>",
    "actions": [
        {
            "card_id": "<card-id>",
            "needs_review": true | false
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

Request description:
- `uuid`: the unique identifier for the deck whose cards are being flagged
- `device`: the name of the device
- `parent_deck_version`: the current version of the deck
- `parent_user_data_version`: the current version of user data for the deck
- `actions`: a list of dictionaries describing whether to flag or unflag specific cards
- `card_id`: the unique identifier for a specific card
- `needs_review`: boolean indicating whether the cards flag should be set (true) or not (false)

Response:
```
{
    user_data_version: <user-data-version>
}
```
Here, `<user-data-version>` indicates the new version of the user data for the deck.

### Share Code Generation
This route generates a deck-specific code. The owner of the deck can share this code with other users so that they can add the decks to their libraries without the deck needing to be public.

Request:
```
GET /api/v1/deck/<uuid>/code
```

Response:
```
{
    "share_code": "<share-code>"
}
```

### Fetch Deck UUID by Share Code
Get a Deck's UUID via its share code.

Request:
```
GET /api/v1/deck/uuid/<share_code>
```

Response
```
{
    "uuid": "<uuid>"
}
```

## Synchronization
Synchronize decks.

### Deck Fetch
Request:
```
GET /api/v1/deck/<uuid>[?share_code=<share_code>]
```
Where `<uuid>` is the unique identifier for the deck being fetched.
If a non-public deck that the user does not own is being requested, the deck's share code must be
provided otherwise the user will not be authorized to view it.

Response: [Standard Full Deck Response](#full-response)

## Library Management
Add and remove decks from your library

### Fetch Library
Request:
```
GET /api/v1/library
```
Response:
```
{
    "decks": [
        <standard metadata deck response 1>,
        <standard metadata deck response 2>,
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Add Remote Deck
Request:
```
POST /api/v1/library/add
{
    "uuid": "<uuid>",
    "device": "<device_name>"[,
    "share_code": "<share_code>"]
}
```
Where `<uuid>` is the unique identifier for the deck being added and `<device_name>` is the name of the device that made the request.
If a deck is not public, it can be added via share code by passing the share code in the payload.
Note that `share_code` is only required for non-public decks.

Response: [Standard Metadata Deck Response](#metadata-response)

### Copy Remote Deck
```
POST /api/v1/library/copy
{
    "uuid": "<uuid>",
    "device": "<device_name>"
}
```
Where `<uuid>` is the unique identifier for the deck being copied and `<device_name>` is the name of the device that made the request.

Response: [Standard Full Deck Response](#full-response)

### Remove Deck
Request:
```
DELETE /api/v1/library/<uuid>
```
Where `<uuid>` is the unique identifier for the deck being removed from the library. If the deck is owned by the user making this call, the deck is also deleted. A response with status 200 indicates success.

### Rate Remote Deck
Request:
```
POST /api/v1/deck/<uuid>/rate
{
    "rating": <rating>
}
```
Where `<rating>` is an integer in the range \[-1, 1\] and `<uuid>` is the unique identifier of a public deck.

        <standard metadata deck response 1>,
        <standard metadata deck response 2>,
        ...
    ]
}
```

### New Decks

```
GET /api/v1/discover/new[?page=<page>]
```
Where `page` is the page offset into the result set (1 by default).

Response:
```
{
    "decks": [
